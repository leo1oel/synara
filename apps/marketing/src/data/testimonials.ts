// FILE: data/testimonials.ts
// Purpose: Canonical list of Synara testimonials sourced from X (Twitter) posts.
// Layer: Static data
// Notes: Each entry is keyed by its tweet id. The live tweet (author, avatar,
//        full text, likes, media) is fetched at render time via lib/tweets.ts —
//        mirroring the link-manager tweet pipeline — so the "Anonymous" / trimmed
//        rows from the original spreadsheet resolve to their real authors. The
//        fallback fields below keep the wall populated if a fetch ever fails.
